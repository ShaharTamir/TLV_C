1. divide the function:  validate, success, result;
2. understand when validate fail -> return fail;
3. understand when successs -> return success;
4. recursive call -> understand what we need to do and keep the result 
to send it back in the recursive return;
5. TRACE -> mark that position is checked.
(only if neccessary for the recursive functionality,
 probably need it).
